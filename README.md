# MT2023_CognitiveDiscounting
This Project contains the code for my Master thesis, where I analyze Cognitive Discounting in New Keynesian Models. The emphasis is on the interaction and effectiveness of Monetary and Fiscal Policy in an economy where some agents are hand-to-mouth consumers and the others are boundedly rational.
- The .R-file replicates the empirical observations figure
- The .mod-files contain the model features of the Two-Agent New Keynesian Model as in Gali et al.(2007) extended by Cognitive Discounting as in Gabaix (2020).
- The .m-files analyzes the model, creating functions and rountines and creating plots
